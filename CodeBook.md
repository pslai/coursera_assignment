# Codebook	
This is the codebook describing the variables in data1.txt and data2.txt, which is created after running "run_Analysis.R".

There are two datasets:  
	1) data1.txt - merged dataset containing only the subject id, activity name, mean and standard deviation of the features  
	2) data2.txt - mean measures for each feature from data1.txt within each level of subject id and activity. These summarized measurements are appended with "-summarized".  
	
	Both data1 and data2 have the following common variables:  
		subjid - subject id for each individual  
		activity - description of type of activity that occurred during the accelerometer measurement  
		
Please see README.md for more information on the details of the experiment and each feature.
